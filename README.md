## A funny story
_When my husband moved to Brussels, he advised me to learn  ````[dʌʧ] lunguage```` . He didn’t elaborate, and I didn’t check it and started learning Danish instead of Dutch. Only after a month did we realize that I was learning the wrong language. Until now I have not yet taken up Danish._
#### Moral: before moving to another country, check the languages spoken by the locals
